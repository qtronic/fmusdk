  <h1>FMU SDK 2.0.6</h1>
  The FMU SDK is a free software development kit provided by
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de" target="_blank">QTronic</a>.
    The FMU SDK demonstrates basic use of Functional Mockup Units (FMUs)
    as defined by the following specifications
    <ul>
    <li>Functional Mock-up Interface for <a href=
    "https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/specifications/v2.0/FMI_for_ModelExchange_and_CoSimulation_v2.0.pdf"

    <li>Functional Mock-up Interface for <a href=

    target="_blank">Co-Simulation 1.0</a> (October 12, 2010)</li>
    </ul>
    The FMI specifications are available from 
    <a href="http://fmi-standard.org/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.
    A short overview on FMUs and the FMI specification can be found
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmi_overview.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    The FMU SDK can also serve as starting point for developing applications 
    that create or process FMUs.
    <p>
    For each of the supported FMI versions (currently 1.0 and 2.0), 
    the FMU SDK contains the C sources for various discrete and continuous 
    FMU models, a batch file for compiling and zip'ing these models, 
    an XML parser for parsing the model description of an FMU and two simple 
    simulation programs that run a given FMU and output the result as CSV file.
    <p>
    The FMU SDK 2.0.6 can be downloaded from 
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip">

<h2><a name="installation">Installing the FMU SDK</a></h2>
The FMU SDK runs on all 32 bit and 64 bit Windows platforms, Linux and Mac OS X platforms.
Download the FMU SDK from <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip">here</a>,
and unzip the file in a directory where you have write access. 
That directory is called FMUSDK_HOME below and may contain white space, such as in "C:\Program Files\fmusdk". 
The FMU SDK contains only the C sources of the FMUs and the simulators, not the executables, 
and should compile on all Windows, Linux and Mac OS X platforms.
<p/>
To build Windows 32 bit versions of all FMUs and simulators of the FMU SDK, 
double click on FMUSDK_HOME\install.bat.
This should create fmus in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu10\fmu and FMUSDK_HOME\fmu20\fmu, as well as four
simulators in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu10\bin and FMUSDK_HOME\fmu20\bin. 
<p/>
To build Windows 64 bit versions of all FMUs and simulators, open a command shell and run "install -win64".
This creates additional fmus in the x64 subdirectories in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu10\fmu and FMUSDK_HOME\fmu20\fmu, as well
as additional simulators in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu10\bin\x64 and FMUSDK_HOME\fmu20\bin\x64. Building these 64 bit versions works also on 32 bit 
Windows platforms. Execution of the 64 bit simulators and fmus requires however a 64 bit version of Windows.
<p/>
Compilation using install.bat requires that you have installed one of
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (VS8), 2008 (VS9), 2010 (VS10), 2012 (VS11), 2013 (VS12) or 2015 (VS14),
for example the free Express Edition.
To compile with another compiler, adapt the batch files.
<p/>
To build Linux or Mac OS X binaries of all FMUs and simulators, open command shell and run "make".
The build requires that you have installed the C and C++ compilers, libexpat and libxml2 libraries.
To install these dependencies on Linux you can use a package manager like 
"sudo apt install g++", "sudo apt install libexpat1-dev", "sudo apt install libxml2-dev".

<hr />
<h2><a name="simulation">Simulating an FMU</a></h2>
On Windows, to run a given FMU with one of the FMU simulators, open a command shell in 
directory FMUSDK_HOME and run the command fmusim
<pre>
fmusim simulator model.fmu [tEnd [h [loggingOn [csvSeparator]]]] [-win64]
  simulator ..... cs10 or cs20 for co-simulation, me10 or me20 for model exchange, required
  model.fmu ..... path to FMU, relative to current dir or absolute, required
  tEnd .......... end  time of simulation, optional, defaults to 1.0 sec
  h ............. step size of simulation, optional, defaults to 0.1 sec
  loggingOn ..... 1 to activate logging,   optional, defaults to 0
  csvSeparator .. c for comma, s for semicolon, optional, defaults to c
  -win64 ........ to use a 64 bit simulator. By default, the 32 bit version is used
</pre>
This unzips the given FMU, parses the contained modelDescription.xml file, simulates
the FMU from t=0 to t=tEnd, and writes the solution to file 'result.csv'. The file
is written in CSV format (comma-separated values), using ';' to separate columns and
using ',' instead of '.' as decimal dot to print floating-point numbers.
To change the result file format, use the 'csv separator' option.
The logging option activates logging of the simulated FMU. The FMI specification does
not specify, what exactly to log in this case. However, when logging is switched on,
the sample FMUs of the FMU SDK log every single FMU function call. Moreover, the
fmusim simulators log every step and every event that is detected.
<p/>
Example command:
<pre>
&gt; fmusim me10 fmu10/fmu/me/bouncingBall.fmu 5 0.1 0 s
FMU Simulator: run 'fmu/bouncingBall.fmu' from t=0..5 with step size h=0.1, loggingOn=0, csv separator=';'
Simulation from 0 to 5 terminated successful
  steps ............ 51
  fixed step size .. 0.1
  time events ...... 0
  state events ..... 14
  step events ...... 0
CSV file 'result.csv' written
</pre>
On Linux and Mac OS X get inspired by <code>run_all</code> target inside FMUSDK_HOME\makefile.
</p>
To plot the result file, open it e.g. in a spread-sheet program, such as Miscrosoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc.
The figure below shows the result of the above simulation when plotted using OpenOffice Calc 3.0.
Note that the height h of the bouncing ball as computed by fmusim becomes negative at the contact points, 
while the true solution of the FMU does actually not contain negative height values. 
This is not a limitation of the FMU, but of fmusim_me, which does not attempt to locate the 
exact time of state events. 
To improve this, either reduce the step size or add your own procedure for state-event location to fmusim_me.
<p/>

<h2><a name="creating_fmus">Creating your own FMUs</a></h2>
The FMU SDK contains a few sample FMUs
<ul>
    <li><a href="../fmu20/src/models/dq/index.html">dq</a> the Dahlquist test function x = -k der(x)</li>
    <li><a href="../fmu20/src/models/inc/index.html">inc</a> increments an integer counter every second</li>
    <li><a href="../fmu20/src/models/values/index.html">values</a> demonstrates the use of all scalar FMU data types</li>
    <li><a href="../fmu20/src/models/vanDerPol/index.html">vanDerPol</a> ODE with 2 continuous states</li>
    <li><a href="../fmu20/src/models/bouncingBall/index.html">bouncingBall</a> a bouncing ball that defines state events</li>
</ul>
To implement your own FMU using the FMU SDK, create a directory - say xy - in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu10\src\models, 
or FMUSDK_HOME\fmu20\src\models, and create files xy.c there.
The name of the new directory and of the .c file must be the same. 
The content of the .c file should follow the existing FMU examples, see the comments in the example code. 
For FMI 1.0, add also file modelDescription.xml.
The XML file must not contain the <code>&lt;implementation&gt;</code>
element and the closing <code>&lt;fmiModelDescription&gt;</code> tag, because this is added automatically during build. 
For FMI 2.0, add file modelDescription_cs.xml and modelDescription_me.xml.
When done with editing xy.c and the xml file (or files), open a command shell in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu10\src\models 
or in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu20\src\models to run the build command.
</p>
On Windows, run command <code>build_fmu me xy</code> to build an FMU for model-exchange, or
<code>build_fmu cs xy</code> to build an FMU for co-simulation. 
This should create a 32 bit FMU file xy.fmu in the corresponding subdirectory of FMUSDK_HOME\fmu10 or FMUSDK_HOME\fmu20.
To build a 64-bit FMU, append option -win64 to the build command.
<p/>
For Linux and Mac OS X get inspired by <code>all</code> target inside FMUSDK_HOME\fmu10\src\models\makefile and FMUSDK_HOME\fmu20\src\models\makefile.
</p>
The figure below might help to create or process the XML file modelDescription.xml. 
It shows all XML elements (without attributes) used in the schema files (XSD) for 
model exchange and co-simulation 1.0. Notation: UML class diagram.
